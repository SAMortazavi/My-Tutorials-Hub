# My Tutorials Hub

Welcome to **My Tutorials Hub**! Here, you'll find a collection of tutorials focused on **PyTorch Lightning** and **MLFlow**, two powerful libraries in the machine learning ecosystem. The tutorials aim to provide hands-on learning, covering various concepts and practical examples that demonstrate how to leverage these tools for model training, evaluation, and experiment tracking.

## Tutorials

### 1. [PyTorch Lightning Tutorial](https://github.com/SAMortazavi/My-Tutorials-Hub/tree/master/Pytorch-Lightning-Tutorial)
This tutorial focuses on **PyTorch Lightning**, a lightweight wrapper for PyTorch that simplifies training and reduces boilerplate code. In this tutorial, you will:

- Learn how to set up and train models using **PyTorch Lightning**.
- Build a **ResNet-50** model to classify images from the **CIFAR-10** dataset.
- Implement features like gradient accumulation, automatic mixed precision, and training on GPUs.
- Use **ModelCheckpoint** and **EarlyStopping** callbacks to improve model training.

**Note:** This tutorial is not focused on achieving high accuracy, but rather on understanding how to efficiently use **PyTorch Lightning** for model training.

### 2. [PyTorch Lightning and MLFlow Tutorial](https://github.com/SAMortazavi/My-Tutorials-Hub/tree/master/Lightning-and-MLFlow-Tutorial)
In this tutorial, we explore the integration of **PyTorch Lightning** with **MLFlow**, a framework for managing the lifecycle of machine learning models, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment. Here, you'll learn how to:

- Train a **ResNet-50** model on the **CIFAR-10** dataset using **PyTorch Lightning**.
- Track experiments and log metrics using **MLFlow**.
- Use **MLFlow**'s tools to visualize training results and store model artifacts.

**Note:** This tutorial emphasizes how to combine **PyTorch Lightning** with **MLFlow** to streamline the machine learning pipeline, rather than focusing solely on achieving the best accuracy.
